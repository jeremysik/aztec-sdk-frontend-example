# Aztec SDK Frontend Example

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. Open console to see debug.

I've included a copy of the SDK with debugging lines added so it's easier to follow.

Note: This example isn't working correctly. It's used for debugging issues with setting up @aztec/sdk v2.1.0-testnet.30
